  <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a target="_blank" href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/">Stanford NLP Group</a> and 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://datascience.stanford.edu/people/data-science-scholars/grid">Stanford Data Science Institute</a> working

      My primary interests involve using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to model social science concepts. 
      My current work is focused on identifying social biases in various domains, including Wikipedia, social media, and social workers' notes. 
      In Fall 2023, I will be joining Johns Hopkins University as an Assistant Professor in computer science.
