    I recieved my Bachelors Degree from Princeton University in Computer Science with minors in Latin and Ancient Greek. My undergraduate thesis advisor was Christiane Fellbaum, and my thesis focused on an automated analysis of Latin. Following college, I worked as a software developer at Five Rings Capital in New York City.
